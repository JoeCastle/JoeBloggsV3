## 1. Ask Questions as a Junior Developer

It's OK to ask questions, even ones you think are "stupid." What's not OK is asking the same question over and over without learning from the answer.

Early in my career, I was afraid to ask questions. I thought I'd look silly. But when I finally did, I realised everyone was happy to help and I learned and progressed much faster.

Show the other person what you have already tried. It will help them understand how you think, so they can guide you more effectively. It will also show them that you are actually trying and not just getting them to do the work for you.

Remember that the senior you are talking to was a junior once too. They know that you are inexperienced.

**Pro Tip:** Write down answers you get, so you don't have to ask twice.

---

## 2. When and How to Ask for Help

Asking for help is a sign of good judgment, not failure.

- Try solving the problem first.
- Google it (<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-google-like-a-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to Google Like a Pro</a>).
- Experiment.
- Then ask for help and show what you've tried so far.

**Checklist:**
- What have you tried?
- What did you expect to happen?
- What actually happened?

Be mindful not to waste hours on a problem that a senior would only need 5 minutes to help you with. Find a balance between working on a problem and asking questions. Consider the difference between spending time and wasting time.

---

## 3. It Is Normal to Feel Overwhelmed

Feeling overwhelmed doesn't mean you're failing, it means you're growing. You are being bombarded with lots of new information, languages, methodologies, software, procedures etc. Your first few months will feel overwhelming.

I still get overwhelmed when learning new tech. The trick is to break things down and focus on one step at a time.

Software development is a big field with a steep learning curve. Even experienced developers don't know everything. Take it one step at a time.

---

## 4. Comparison Steals Your Joy

Comparing yourself to more experienced devs can harm your confidence.  
There will always be someone better, faster, or more confident than you. Don't measure yourself against them.

Only compare yourself only to who you were yesterday, and who you want to be tomorrow.

**Quote:** "Don't compare your chapter 1 to someone else's chapter 20."

---

## 5. Mistakes Are Learning Opportunities

Mistakes are part of the job, and an essential part of learning.

When you mess up, learn from it. And when others mess up, learn from them. Every mistake is a chance to learn and understand something new.

Minimise the effects of potential mistakes. Make frequent backups etc.

**Pro Tip:** When you make a mistake or find a bug, write down what happened and how you fixed it.

---

## 6. Build Projects to Grow Your Skills

The best way to learn programming is by building things.

- Create side projects
- Rebuild tools you use
- Try new tech in a safe, personal space

**Checklist:**
- Pick a project that you find interesting
- Break it into smaller tasks
- Share your code on GitHub

I became a better programmer by working on project after project. I was able to see the common successes and failures and was able to learn from them.

Building projects will also allow you to showcase your skills to potential employers.

---

## 7. Overcoming Imposter Syndrome

You'll feel like a fraud at times. You'll doubt your abilities. You'll fear failure. Everyone does, even senior developers.

Being a developer is difficult. Writing code is difficult. Creating projects is difficult. Learning new technologies is difficult.

You never fully escape this, but it does get better.

---

## 8. Effective Developer Note‑Taking

Help your future self out by making simple, useful notes.

- TODO lists to track your day.
- Analysing tasks and breaking tasks into smaller steps.
- Writing down what you were doing before you stopped work.
- Summarizing concepts or errors you've encountered.
- Storing useful code snippets or scripts.

I started with pen and paper, then began using Notepad++, but that became difficult to manage as I added more notes. Also, it was annoying to transfer the notes between computers.

Now I use Obsidian, but others like Notion are good options too.

Even a paper notepad and pen sitting next to you on your desk can be very useful.

**Tools:** <a href="https://www.notion.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Notion</a>, <a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Obsidian</a>, <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Markdown</a>

**Pro tip:** Write about tasks, achievements, challenges and projects when they are still fresh in your mind. This will be useful later when writing your CV and discussing them in interviews.

## 9. Break Down Complex Tasks

> "How do you eat an elephant?"
One bite at a time.

Break complex problems into smaller, manageable steps. Start with what you know. Then work your way through the unknowns bit by bit.

Start writing notes before writing code. Plan what needs to be done first and what can be left for last.

---

## 10. Take Breaks to Sharpen Your Thinking

Sometimes, stepping away is the best debugging tool.

- Go for a short walk
- Make a drink
- Do something else for 10 minutes

You'll be surprised by how many problems you'll solve as you are going about your everyday chores, or even as you're drifting off to sleep. I find it handy to keep a small note pad next to my desk so I can remember the solution for when I wake up.

---

## 11. Use Rubber Duck Debugging

Explaining your problem out loud can help you spot the solution.  
Talk through the code with a "rubber duck", or a friendly coworker.

Explain the problem aloud as if you're teaching it to a rubber duck or as if your are asking a question to a senior developer. You'll often figure out the issue mid-explanation.

I keep a rubber duck on my desk. It works!

## 12. Get Good at Googling

Googling effectively is one of the most underrated developer skills.

No one expects you to remember everything. but you're expected to know **how to find** the answer when you need it. Get good at searching, scanning results, and knowing which sources to trust.

**Tips:**
- Use specific error messages or error codes
- Add the language or framework to your search
- Check Stack Overflow, official docs, and GitHub issues
- Ask chatbots like GPT, though be aware they can be confidently wrong.
- Use advanced search features (<a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Refine Google searches</a>)

I Google all of the time. I ask chatbots frequently. I often check stack overflow. I did it when I was a junior and I still do it as a senior.

As you gain more experience you will be able to sift through irrelevant results more quickly.

## 13. AI Tools Need Human Oversight

AI tools like ChatGPT can save time, but they're not infallible.

They are tools. But if you only use a hammer, everything looks like a nail.

- Always sanity-check code you get from AI
- Understand *why* it works so you can learn
- Never let it replace actual learning or critical thinking

## 14. Write Maintainable Code from Day One

Clear, clean code helps your future self and teammates.  
Include comments, write thoughtful commit messages, and document decisions.

Every change you make affects others. Think ahead.

- Will this break something?
- Is it performant?
- Is it secure?
- Can other developers understand it?

Be Conscientious.

---

## 15. Why Soft Skills Matter

Your technical skills matter, but communication and teamwork matter too.  

Being a good developer isn't just about code.

- Communicate clearly. Other people don't have the information in your head.
- Listen well and pay attention, but don't be afraid to ask for clarification.
- Provide context. A Teams or Slack message with context will make it easier for the other person to respond.

Remember, you're working with people, not just computers.

You'll frequently be collaborating with people who don't have technical knowledge:
- Designers
- Customers
- Managers

---

## 16. Write Code With the Bus Factor in Mind

Think about whether someone else can understand your work if you're away.  
Use clear naming, documentation, and share knowledge through readmes and hand-offs.

If you disappeared tomorrow, would anyone else be able to understand your work?

---

## 17. Build Your Online Presence

Your online presence shows who you are as a developer.  
Keep your GitHub up to date, write blog posts, share projects, and build a LinkedIn profile to amplify your work.

## Final Thoughts

Starting your tech journey can feel overwhelming, but every senior dev has been where you are now.  
Focus on asking good questions, building in public, learning from mistakes, and applying these practical habits every day.

Each small step compounds into real growth. Keep going.
