## 1. Best Programming Languages for Junior Developers

One of the most common questions new developers ask is: what programming language should I start with? Here's a quick comparison to help you choose.

| Language    | Best For                | Pros                                   | Cons                  |
|-------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| JavaScript  | Web development         | Huge community, easy to start, in-demand | Can be quirky, async can confuse beginners |
| Python      | Data science, scripting | Readable, versatile, lots of tutorials | Slower for some apps  |
| Java/C#     | Enterprise, mobile      | Strong typing, jobs in big companies   | Verbose, steeper learning curve |

**My advice:** Pick one that matches your interests and stick with it long enough to build something real. Consistency beats chasing the "perfect" language.

I started with VisualBasic and VB.NET in school. Then I used Java in university. Now I professionally build websites using React, .NET, and SQL Server.

The languages you use will change. Your needs will change.

## 2. Do I Need a Computer Science Degree to Get a Job?

**Short answer:** No. Many developers are self-taught or come from bootcamps. What matters most is your ability to solve problems, build things, and communicate.

According to Stack Overflow's 2024 survey, about 40% of developers don't have a CS degree, with about 20% having no degree at all.

**Alternative paths:**
- Self-study (YouTube, blogs, open-source, personal projects etc)
- MOOCs (e.g., <a href="https://www.coursera.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coursera</a>, <a href="https://www.edx.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">edX</a>)
- Apprenticeships
- Coding bootcamps


**Long answer:** It depends. It's an option that provide structured learning and shows employers that you can work to deadlines. You're presented with and guided through a wide range of topics.

It's an additional certification that you can add to your CV. You will be competing with other developers, so if another developer has similar experience and projects as you do, them having a degree could shift it in their favour.

However, employers will be more impressed by projects and experience. So work on projects that you can demo which will prove to employers that you can actually code and create projects. I'd be more likely to hire someone with no degree that can showcase projects, rather than someone with a degree and no projects under their belt.

Also, you'd be surprised by how many candidates finish a degree but are unable to code.

Realisticly you can get the equivalent of a degree for free online. You mainly lose out on the structure, guidance and certificate. The main benefit of skipping a degree is no student loan.

Most importantly:
- Can you solve problems?
- Can you build projects and explain your code?
- Can you collaborate?

Full disclosure: I have a BSc in Computer Science and I found my first job through my university.

## 3. Projects to Build as a Junior Developer

To gain experience, build projects that solve real problems or showcase your skills. Employers love to see what you’ve made, not just what you know.

Here are some ideas:
- Portfolio website (show off your work)
- To-do list app with local storage or a backend
- Weather app using an API
- Simple blog platform (build your own blog)
- Budgeting or habit tracker
- Game (even a simple one like Tic-Tac-Toe)
- Clone a popular app (Twitter, Reddit, etc.)

**Resources for ideas:**
- <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frontend Mentor</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Build Your Own X</a>
- <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-projects-for-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">freeCodeCamp Project Ideas</a>

**Mini-guide:**
1. Pick a project that interests you.
2. Create an MVP, break it into small tasks.
3. Build, document, and share it on GitHub.
4. Write about what you learned.
5. Iterate or build new projects.

## 4. How do you Stand Out to Employers as a Junior Developer?

To get noticed, show real initiative. That means building projects, sharing your work, and making it easy for others to see what you're capable of.

**Checklist:**
- Personal, professional or open-source projects
- Clear and straightforward portfolio site
- Professional looking LinkedIn profile
- Appropriate and well structured CV
- Enthusiasm and willingness to learn

## 5. What's the Difference Between Junior, Mid-Level, and Senior Developers?

| Level   | Experience      | Typical Skills & Responsibilities                |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Junior  | <2 years        | Needs mentoring, learning fundamentals          |
| Mid     | 2–5 years       | Owns features, works more independently         |
| Senior  | 5+ years        | Leads projects, mentors, shapes architecture    |

Though it mostly depends on the company as some have more particular requirements.

## 6. Why Soft Skills Matter for Developers?

Soft skills like communication and teamwork are just as important as coding ability. Developers work with people, not just computers. So be mindful that you will also need to:
- Communicate ideas clearly
- Work well on a team
- Handle feedback and collaboration
- Adapt to change and uncertainty

Remember that other people don't have the same information that you have in your head. Provide them with context when communicating, especially when messaging over Teams or Slack.

"how do I do blank" isn't very informative.

Try something like this:

"I'm on project A and I'm having some issues with B.
My goal is to achieve C but I'm only able to output D.
I've tried X, Y and Z.
Do you know how to achieve this or where I'm going wrong?"

The second message rovides much more context and helps others exclude approaches you have already tried.

And please use punctuation. It makes messages, especially long ones, much easier to read.

## 7. Ways to Get Real-World Experience Without a Dev Job

You don’t need a job to build experience. Create your own projects, contribute to open-source, or help out a local business.

- Build and publish personal projects
- Contribute to open-source (start with <a href="https://goodfirstissue.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">good first issues</a>)
- Freelance or build for a local business
- Participate in hackathons (<a href="https://devpost.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Devpost</a>)
- Volunteer for nonprofits (<a href="https://www.catchafire.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Catchafire</a>)

**Step-by-step: Your first open-source PR**
1. Find a beginner-friendly repo
2. Read the contribution guide
3. Fix a typo or small bug
4. Submit your pull request

## 8. What Should I Include in My Developer Portfolio?

**Portfolio essentials:**
- Short bio (who you are)
- Links to projects (with descriptions and GitHub links)
- Contact info
- LinkedIn profile
- Optional: résumé, testimonials, blog

Here's my Github and Porfolio website:

- <a href="https://github.com/JoeCastle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>
- <a href="https://joecastle.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Portfolio</a>

**Common mistakes:**
- Too many poor quality projects, not enough detail, no screenshots, no links to demos, broken demos.
- No contact info.
- Outdated or broken links.

**The core structure of your visibility to employers will be:**
- Portfolio website
    - Display and write about your projects. Link to the demos and GitHub repositories.
- GitHub
    - Add comments and tests to your projects.
    - Ensure each project has a README file. As well as screenshots if you don't have them on your portfolio.
- LinkedIn
    - This will be more beneficial as you gain more experience and connections. But you can still display your projects and certifications.
- CV
    - There's plenty of CV guides out there, so don't come up with your own design. The simpler the better.
    - Don't waste space be leaving gaps every where.

## 9. How Do I Prepare for Technical Interviews?

- Practice algorithms and data structures (<a href="https://leetcode.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LeetCode</a>, <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HackerRank</a>)
- Review the basics of your chosen language. Basic syntax and functions.
- Be ready to explain your projects and decisions.
- Prepare for behavioral questions. ("Tell me about a time when...")
- Mock interview with friends or family.

**Mock interview script:**
- Q: "Tell me about a project you're proud of."
- A: "I built a budgeting app using React and Firebase. I learned how to manage authentication and real-time data. The biggest challenge was..."

One of the things the interviewer is looking at is how you approach and solve problems. So it isn't a problem if you don't have the solution right away and need to work it out.

In the interview, it's ok to say "I don't know", if you don't know the answer. Turn this into an advantage. Ask the interviewer and turn it into a discussion and an opportunity to learn.

You can still benefit from failed interviews. Interviewing is a skill that takes practice.

## 10. What Should I Focus on Learning First?

**Learning roadmap:**
1. Fundamentals of one language (JavaScript or Python)
2. Version control (Git, GitHub)
3. Basic HTML/CSS (for web dev)
4. Build simple projects
5. Understand how the web works (HTTP, APIs, client/server)

**30-day challenge:**
- Day 1–10: Learn language basics
- Day 11–25: Build a small project
- Day 26–30: Share it online and get feedback

---

## Summary: Your First Steps as a Junior Developer

To get started as a junior developer:

- Choose one language and build real projects with it
- Share your work through a portfolio, GitHub, and LinkedIn
- Focus on learning by doing, not just watching tutorials
- Practice communication and teamwork, not just code
- Apply to jobs, join communities, and stay curious

You don’t need to know everything. You just need to start building and keep learning.

Every developer starts as a beginner. Keep going, and you’ll get there.
