# Welcome!

Hi, I'm Joe â€” a software developer, sci-fi enthusiast, and lifelong learner. I started this blog to share my journey, lessons learned, and the occasional rant.

## Why This Blog?

When I was starting out, I found the tech world both exciting and overwhelming. There were so many resources, but it was hard to find practical advice. My goal is to create the kind of blog I wish I'd found as a junior developer: friendly, helpful, and straightforward.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Career advice** for junior and aspiring developers
- **Stories from the trenches** real-world lessons, mistakes, and wins
- **Coding tutorials and walkthroughs** (from beginner to advanced)
- **Book and tool reviews**
- **Sci-fi references and tie-ins** (because why not?)

## My Goal

I believe learning should be fun, inclusive, and community-driven. Whether you're just starting out or looking to level up, I hope you'll find something here to inspire and empower you.
