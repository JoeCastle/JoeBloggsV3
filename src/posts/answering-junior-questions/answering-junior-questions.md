Starting a career in software development can feel overwhelming. In my first few months I was excited, confused, and bombarded by information from every direction. If you're reading this, you're probably facing the same questions I did. This post is here to help you cut through the noise, find your path, and start building your future in tech.

Whether you're just getting started or trying to level up, this post is for you. I've gathered the most common questions junior developers ask, and I'll share practical answers, real stories, and resources to help you move forward.

## 1. What programming language should I start with?

There's no single "best" language, but here's a quick comparison to help you decide:

| Language    | Best For                | Pros                                   | Cons                  |
|-------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| JavaScript  | Web development         | Huge community, easy to start, in-demand | Can be quirky, async can confuse beginners |
| Python      | Data science, scripting | Readable, versatile, lots of tutorials | Slower for some apps  |
| Java/C#     | Enterprise, mobile      | Strong typing, jobs in big companies   | Verbose, steeper learning curve |
| Ruby        | Web (Rails)             | Elegant syntax, friendly community     | Less demand than JS/Python |

**My advice:** Pick one that matches your interests and stick with it long enough to build something real. Consistency beats chasing the "perfect" language.

**Resources:**
- [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)
- [Python.org Beginner's Guide](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)

I started with VisualBasic and VB.NET in school. Then I used Java in university. Now I professionally build websites using React, .NET, and SQL Server.

The languages you use will change. Your needs will change.

## 2. Do I need a computer science degree to get a job?

Short answer: No. Many developers are self-taught or come from bootcamps. What matters most is your ability to solve problems, build things, and communicate.

According to Stack Overflow's 2023 survey, over 40% of developers don't have a CS degree.

**Alternative paths:**
- Coding bootcamps (e.g., [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com/), [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/))
- MOOCs (e.g., [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), [edX](https://www.edx.org/))
- Self-study (YouTube, blogs, open-source)

Long answer: It depends. It's an options that provide structured learning and shows employers that you can work to deadlines. 

It's an additional certification that you can add to your CV. You will be competing with other developers, so if another developer has similar experience and projects as you do, them having a degree could shift it in their favour.

However, employers will be more impressed by projects and experience. So work on projects that you can demo which will prove to employers that you can actually code and create projects.

Also, you'd be surprised by how many developers finish a degree but are unable to code.

Most importantly:
- Can you solve problems?
- Can you build projects and explain your code?
- Can you collaborate?

Full disclosure: I have a BSc in Computer Science.

## 3. What projects should I build to gain experience?

Build projects that solve real problems or showcase your skills. Here are some ideas:
- Portfolio website (show off your work!)
- To-do list app with local storage or a backend
- Weather app using an API
- Simple blog platform (build your own blog!)
- Budgeting or habit tracker
- Game (even a simple one like Tic-Tac-Toe)
- Clone a popular app (Twitter, Reddit, etc.)

**Resources for ideas:**
- [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/)
- [Build Your Own X](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x)
- [freeCodeCamp Project Ideas](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-projects-junior-developer/)

**Mini-guide:**
1. Pick a project that excites you.
2. Break it into small tasks.
3. Build, document, and share it on GitHub.
4. Write a blog post about what you learned.

## 4. How can I stand out to employers as a junior developer?

**Checklist:**
- Personal, professional or open-source projects
- Clear and straightforward portfolio site
- Professional looking LinkedIn profile
- Appropriate and well structured CV
- Enthusiasm and willingness to learn

## 5. What's the difference between junior, mid-level, and senior developers?

| Level   | Experience      | Typical Skills & Responsibilities                |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Junior  | <2 years        | Needs mentoring, learning fundamentals          |
| Mid     | 2–5 years       | Owns features, works more independently         |
| Senior  | 5+ years        | Leads projects, mentors, shapes architecture    |

Though it mostly depends on the company as some have more particular requirements.

## 6. How important are soft skills in development?

**Crucial!**
- Communicate ideas clearly
- Work well on a team
- Handle feedback and collaboration
- Adapt to change and uncertainty

Remember that other people don't have the same information that you have in your head. Provide them with context when communicating. Especially when messaging over Teams or Slack.

"how do I do blank" isn't very informative.

Try something like this:

"I'm on project A and I'm having some issues with B.
My goal is to achieve C but I'm only able to output D.
I've tried X, Y and Z.
Do you know how to achieve this?"

The second message rovides much more context and helps others exclude approaches you have already tried.

And please use punctuation. It makes messages, especially long one, much easier to read.

## 7. How can I gain real-world experience without a job?

- Build and publish personal projects
- Contribute to open-source (start with [good first issues](https://goodfirstissue.dev/))
- Freelance or build for a local business
- Participate in hackathons ([Devpost](https://devpost.com/))
- Volunteer for nonprofits ([Catchafire](https://www.catchafire.org/))

**Step-by-step: Your first open-source PR**
1. Find a beginner-friendly repo
2. Read the contribution guide
3. Fix a typo or small bug
4. Submit your pull request

<!-- **Story:** My first PR was fixing a typo. It felt small, but it gave me the confidence to tackle bigger issues. -->

## 8. What should I include in my developer portfolio?

**Portfolio essentials:**
- Short bio (who you are)
- Links to projects (with descriptions and GitHub links)
- Contact info
- LinkedIn profile
- Optional: résumé, testimonials, blog

<!-- **Inspiration:**
- [Brittany Chiang](https://brittanychiang.com/)
- [Tim Baker](https://www.timbakerdev.com/) -->

**Common mistakes:**
- Too many projects, not enough detail, no screenshots, no links to demos, broken demos.
- No contact info
- Outdated or broken links

## 9. How do I prepare for technical interviews?

- Practice algorithms and data structures ([LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/))
- Review the basics of your chosen language
- Be ready to explain your projects and decisions
- Prepare for behavioral questions ("Tell me about a time when...")
- Mock interview with friends or mentors ([Pramp](https://www.pramp.com/))

**Mock interview script:**
- Q: "Tell me about a project you're proud of."
- A: "I built a budgeting app using React and Firebase. I learned how to manage authentication and real-time data. The biggest challenge was..."

## 10. What should I focus on learning first?

**Learning roadmap:**
1. Fundamentals of one language (JavaScript or Python)
2. Version control (Git, GitHub)
3. Basic HTML/CSS (for web dev)
4. Build simple projects
5. Understand how the web works (HTTP, APIs, client/server)

**30-day challenge:**
- Day 1–10: Learn language basics
- Day 11–20: Build a small project
- Day 21–30: Share it online and get feedback

## Final Thoughts

There's a lot of noise online, and a lot of pressure when you're just starting out. My advice? Start simple. Build stuff. Ask for help. Be kind to yourself.

Every developer you look up to once stood exactly where you are now—asking these same questions. 

Keep building, keep learning
